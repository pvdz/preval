// Preval symbols representing JS built-ins or other special casings for Preval, like $coerce or $dotCall

// With the builtin symbols, the convention is to use capitalized construct name
// for static members and lower cased construct name for prototype members.
// For example: $String_fromCharCode vs $string_charCodeAt
