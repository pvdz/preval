## Input

`````js filename=intro
const arrAssignPatternRhs = [``, 4, 5];
const arrPatternSplat = [...arrAssignPatternRhs];
const arrPatternStep = arrPatternSplat[0];
const arrPatternSplat$1 = [...arrPatternStep];
arrPatternSplat$1.slice(0);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro

`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro

`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro

`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const arrAssignPatternRhs = [``, 4, 5];
const arrPatternSplat = [...arrAssignPatternRhs];
const arrPatternStep = arrPatternSplat[0];
const arrPatternSplat$1 = [...arrPatternStep];
const tmpMCF = arrPatternSplat$1.slice;
$dotCall(tmpMCF, arrPatternSplat$1, `slice`, 0);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) access object property that also exists on prototype? $array_slice
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) type trackeed tricks can possibly support static $array_slice
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
