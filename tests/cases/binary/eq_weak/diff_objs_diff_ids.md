## Input

`````js filename=intro
const x = {};
const y = x;
$(x == y);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(true);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(true);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( true );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const x = {};
const y = x;
let tmpCalleeParam = x == y;
$(tmpCalleeParam);
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: true
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
