## Input

`````js filename=intro
const x = {};
const y = x;
$(x !== y);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(false);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(false);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( false );
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: false
 - eval returned: undefined

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same
