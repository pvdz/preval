## Input

`````js filename=intro
$(Math.hypot.call({}, 5));
// Expected: 5
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(5);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(5);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 5 );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpMCOO = $Math_hypot;
const tmpMCF = tmpMCOO.call;
const tmpMCP = {};
let tmpCalleeParam = $dotCall(tmpMCF, tmpMCOO, `call`, tmpMCP, 5);
$(tmpCalleeParam);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) type trackeed tricks can possibly support static $Math_hypot


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 5
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
