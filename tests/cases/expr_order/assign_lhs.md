Must take into account that the simple node i will still change value if we move the complex node to appear before it.

## Input

`````js filename=intro
let i = 0;
let j = ++i + i;
$(j);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(2);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(2);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 2 );
`````


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 2
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
