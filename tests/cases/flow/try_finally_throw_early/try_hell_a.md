## Input

`````js filename=intro
let x = 0;
try {
  x = 1
} catch {

}
$(x);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 1 );
`````


## Todos triggered

## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 1
 - eval returned: undefined
