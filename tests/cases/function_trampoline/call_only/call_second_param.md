## Input

`````js filename=intro
const f = function(a, b, c, d, e) {
  $(c);
};
f(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // This should end up being $(3)
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(3);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(3);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 3 );
`````


## Todos triggered

## Globals

## Runtime Outcome
