## Input

`````js filename=intro
const f = function(a, b, c, d, e) {
  $(this);
};
f(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // The use of `this` should prevent inlining this call, for now
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(undefined);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(undefined);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( undefined );
`````


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: undefined
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
