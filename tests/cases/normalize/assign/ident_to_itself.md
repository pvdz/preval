Since we don't consider idents to have observable side effects, this should be a noop.

Not very likely to happen in the wild, though it may be an artifact after some normalization / reduction.

## Input

`````js filename=intro
let a = $(10);
a = a;
$(a);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const a /*:unknown*/ = $(10);
$(a);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$($(10));
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = $( 10 );
$( a );
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 10
 - 2: 10
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
