## Input

`````js filename=intro
let a = 1, b = {x: 2}, c = 3, d = 4;
for (let a = b.x = c + d;false;) $(a, b, c);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro

`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro

`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro

`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let a = 1;
let b = { x: 2 };
let c = 3;
let d = 4;
const tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs = c + d;
b.x = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs;
let a$1 = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs;
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
