React is doing this but we can't reliably

## Input

`````js filename=intro
$(Math.pow(2, 53));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(9007199254740992);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(9007199254740992);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 9007199254740992 );
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 9007199254740992
 - eval returned: undefined
