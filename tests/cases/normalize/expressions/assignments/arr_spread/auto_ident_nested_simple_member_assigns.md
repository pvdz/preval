## Input

`````js filename=intro
let b = { x: 1 },
  c = 3;

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
$([...(a = b.x = b.x = b.x = b.x = b.x = b.x = c)]);
$(a, b, c);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`const tmpCalleeParam = [...3];\`)`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`const tmpCalleeParam = [...3];\`)`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
throw "Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by `const tmpCalleeParam = [...3];`)";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let b = { x: 1 };
let c = 3;
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
const tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$7 = c;
b.x = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$7;
const tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$5 = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$7;
b.x = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$5;
const tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$3 = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$5;
b.x = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$3;
const tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$1 = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$3;
b.x = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$1;
const tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$1;
b.x = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs;
const tmpNestedAssignPropRhs = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs;
const tmpNestedPropAssignRhs = tmpNestedAssignPropRhs;
b.x = tmpNestedPropAssignRhs;
a = tmpNestedPropAssignRhs;
const tmpArrSpread = a;
let tmpCalleeParam = [...tmpArrSpread];
$(tmpCalleeParam);
$(a, b, c);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same
