## Input

`````js filename=intro
let arg = { y: 1 };

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
let obj = {};
(a = delete $(arg).y)["a"];
$(a, arg);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const arg /*:object*/ /*truthy*/ = { y: 1 };
const tmpDeleteObj /*:unknown*/ = $(arg);
const a /*:boolean*/ = delete tmpDeleteObj.y;
a.a;
$(a, arg);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
const arg = { y: 1 };
const tmpDeleteObj = $(arg);
const a = delete tmpDeleteObj.y;
a.a;
$(a, arg);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = { y: 1 };
const b = $( a );
const c = delete b.y;
c.a;
$( c, a );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let arg = { y: 1 };
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
let obj = {};
const tmpDeleteObj = $(arg);
a = delete tmpDeleteObj.y;
const tmpCompObj = a;
tmpCompObj.a;
$(a, arg);
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: { y: '1' }
 - 2: true, {}
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same
