## Input

`````js filename=intro
let arg = { y: 1 };

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
export default a = delete arg["y"];
$(a, arg);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const arg /*:object*/ /*truthy*/ = { y: 1 };
const a /*:boolean*/ = delete arg.y;
export { a as default };
$(a, arg);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
const arg = { y: 1 };
const a = delete arg.y;
export { a as default };
$(a, arg);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = { y: 1 };
const b = delete a.y;
export { b as default };
$( b, a );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let arg = { y: 1 };
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
a = delete arg.y;
const tmpAnonDefaultExport = a;
export { tmpAnonDefaultExport as default };
$(a, arg);
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ("<crash[ Unexpected token 'export' ]>")

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
