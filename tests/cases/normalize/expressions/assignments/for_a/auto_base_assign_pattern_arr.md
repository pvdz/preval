## Input

`````js filename=intro
let b = [];

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
for (a = [b] = $([$(2)]); ; $(1));
$(a, b);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrElement /*:unknown*/ = $(2);
const tmpCalleeParam /*:array*/ = [tmpArrElement];
const tmpNestedAssignArrPatternRhs /*:unknown*/ = $(tmpCalleeParam);
[...tmpNestedAssignArrPatternRhs];
while ($LOOP_DONE_UNROLLING_ALWAYS_TRUE) {
  $(1);
}
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrElement = $(2);
const tmpNestedAssignArrPatternRhs = $([tmpArrElement]);
[...tmpNestedAssignArrPatternRhs];
while (true) {
  $(1);
}
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = $( 2 );
const b = [ a ];
const c = $( b );
[ ...c ];
while ($LOOP_DONE_UNROLLING_ALWAYS_TRUE) {
  $( 1 );
}
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) do we want to support ArrayExpression as expression statement in free loops?
- (todo) support array reads statement type VarStatement
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 2
 - 2: [2]
 - 3: 1
 - 4: 1
 - 5: 1
 - 6: 1
 - 7: 1
 - 8: 1
 - 9: 1
 - 10: 1
 - 11: 1
 - 12: 1
 - 13: 1
 - 14: 1
 - 15: 1
 - 16: 1
 - 17: 1
 - 18: 1
 - 19: 1
 - 20: 1
 - 21: 1
 - 22: 1
 - 23: 1
 - 24: 1
 - 25: 1
 - 26: 1
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ Loop aborted by Preval test runner (this simply curbs infinite loops in tests) ]>')
