## Input

`````js filename=intro
let x = 1,
  y = 2;

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
for (a = [x, y] = [$(3), $(4)]; ; $(1));
$(a, x, y);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(3);
$(4);
while ($LOOP_DONE_UNROLLING_ALWAYS_TRUE) {
  $(1);
}
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(3);
$(4);
while (true) {
  $(1);
}
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 3 );
$( 4 );
while ($LOOP_DONE_UNROLLING_ALWAYS_TRUE) {
  $( 1 );
}
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let x = 1;
let y = 2;
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
const tmpArrElement = $(3);
const tmpArrElement$1 = $(4);
const tmpNestedAssignArrPatternRhs = [tmpArrElement, tmpArrElement$1];
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpNestedAssignArrPatternRhs];
x = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
y = tmpArrPatternSplat[1];
a = tmpNestedAssignArrPatternRhs;
while (true) {
  $(1);
}
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) array reads var statement with init ArrayExpression
- (todo) do we want to support ArrayExpression as expression statement in free loops?
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 3
 - 2: 4
 - 3: 1
 - 4: 1
 - 5: 1
 - 6: 1
 - 7: 1
 - 8: 1
 - 9: 1
 - 10: 1
 - 11: 1
 - 12: 1
 - 13: 1
 - 14: 1
 - 15: 1
 - 16: 1
 - 17: 1
 - 18: 1
 - 19: 1
 - 20: 1
 - 21: 1
 - 22: 1
 - 23: 1
 - 24: 1
 - 25: 1
 - 26: 1
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ Loop aborted by Preval test runner (this simply curbs infinite loops in tests) ]>')
