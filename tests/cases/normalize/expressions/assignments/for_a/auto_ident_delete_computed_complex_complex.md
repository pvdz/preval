## Input

`````js filename=intro
let arg = { y: 1 };

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
for (a = delete $(arg)[$("y")]; ; $(1));
$(a, arg);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const arg /*:object*/ = { y: 1 };
const tmpDeleteCompObj /*:unknown*/ = $(arg);
const tmpDeleteCompProp /*:unknown*/ = $(`y`);
delete tmpDeleteCompObj[tmpDeleteCompProp];
while ($LOOP_DONE_UNROLLING_ALWAYS_TRUE) {
  $(1);
}
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpDeleteCompObj = $({ y: 1 });
const tmpDeleteCompProp = $(`y`);
delete tmpDeleteCompObj[tmpDeleteCompProp];
while (true) {
  $(1);
}
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = { y: 1 };
const b = $( a );
const c = $( "y" );
delete b[ c ];
while ($LOOP_DONE_UNROLLING_ALWAYS_TRUE) {
  $( 1 );
}
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) computed property access of an ident where the property ident is not recorded;


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: { y: '1' }
 - 2: 'y'
 - 3: 1
 - 4: 1
 - 5: 1
 - 6: 1
 - 7: 1
 - 8: 1
 - 9: 1
 - 10: 1
 - 11: 1
 - 12: 1
 - 13: 1
 - 14: 1
 - 15: 1
 - 16: 1
 - 17: 1
 - 18: 1
 - 19: 1
 - 20: 1
 - 21: 1
 - 22: 1
 - 23: 1
 - 24: 1
 - 25: 1
 - 26: 1
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ Loop aborted by Preval test runner (this simply curbs infinite loops in tests) ]>')
