## Input

`````js filename=intro
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
for (; (a = [1, 2, 3]); $(1));
$(a);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
while ($LOOP_DONE_UNROLLING_ALWAYS_TRUE) {
  $(1);
}
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
while (true) {
  $(1);
}
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
while ($LOOP_DONE_UNROLLING_ALWAYS_TRUE) {
  $( 1 );
}
`````

- (todo) support array reads statement type BreakStatement
- (todo) support array reads statement type WhileStatement
- (todo) support array reads statement type EmptyStatement
- (todo) do we want to support ArrayExpression as expression statement in free loops?
