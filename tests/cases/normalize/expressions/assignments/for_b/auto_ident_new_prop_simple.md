## Input

`````js filename=intro
let b = { $ };

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
for (; (a = new b.$(1)); $(1));
$(a);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
while ($LOOP_DONE_UNROLLING_ALWAYS_TRUE) {
  new $(1);
  $(1);
}
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
while (true) {
  new $(1);
  $(1);
}
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
while ($LOOP_DONE_UNROLLING_ALWAYS_TRUE) {
  new $( 1 );
  $( 1 );
}
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let b = { $: $ };
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
while (true) {
  const tmpNewCallee = b.$;
  a = new tmpNewCallee(1);
  const tmpIfTest = a;
  if (tmpIfTest) {
    $(1);
  } else {
    break;
  }
}
$(a);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Support referencing this builtin in isFree: $
- (todo) do we want to support NewExpression as expression statement in free loops?
- (todo) do we want to support ObjectExpression as expression statement in free loops?
- (todo) objects in isFree check


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 1
 - 2: 1
 - 3: 1
 - 4: 1
 - 5: 1
 - 6: 1
 - 7: 1
 - 8: 1

 - 20: 1
 - 21: 1
 - 22: 1
 - 23: 1
 - 24: 1
 - 25: 1
 - 26: 1
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ Loop aborted by Preval test runner (this simply curbs infinite loops in tests) ]>')
