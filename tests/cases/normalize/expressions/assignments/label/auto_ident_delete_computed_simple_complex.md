## Input

`````js filename=intro
let arg = { y: 1 };

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
label: a = delete arg[$("y")];
$(a, arg);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const tmpDeleteCompProp /*:unknown*/ = $(`y`);
const arg /*:object*/ /*truthy*/ = { y: 1 };
const a /*:boolean*/ = delete arg[tmpDeleteCompProp];
$(a, arg);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpDeleteCompProp = $(`y`);
const arg = { y: 1 };
$(delete arg[tmpDeleteCompProp], arg);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = $( "y" );
const b = { y: 1 };
const c = delete b[ a ];
$( c, b );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let arg = { y: 1 };
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
const tmpDeleteCompObj = arg;
const tmpDeleteCompProp = $(`y`);
a = delete tmpDeleteCompObj[tmpDeleteCompProp];
$(a, arg);
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'y'
 - 2: true, {}
 - eval returned: undefined
