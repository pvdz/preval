## Input

`````js filename=intro
let arg = { y: 1 };

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
let obj = {};
(a = delete arg.y).a;
$(a, arg);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const arg /*:object*/ /*truthy*/ = { y: 1 };
const a /*:boolean*/ = delete arg.y;
a.a;
$(a, arg);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
const arg = { y: 1 };
const a = delete arg.y;
a.a;
$(a, arg);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = { y: 1 };
const b = delete a.y;
b.a;
$( b, a );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let arg = { y: 1 };
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
let obj = {};
a = delete arg.y;
const tmpCompObj = a;
tmpCompObj.a;
$(a, arg);
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: true, {}
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same
