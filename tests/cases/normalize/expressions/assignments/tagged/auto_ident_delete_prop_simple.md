## Input

`````js filename=intro
let arg = { y: 1 };

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
$`before ${(a = delete arg.y)} after`;
$(a, arg);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const arg /*:object*/ /*truthy*/ = { y: 1 };
const a /*:boolean*/ = delete arg.y;
const tmpCalleeParam /*:array*/ /*truthy*/ = [`before `, ` after`];
$(tmpCalleeParam, a);
$(a, arg);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
const arg = { y: 1 };
const a = delete arg.y;
$([`before `, ` after`], a);
$(a, arg);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = { y: 1 };
const b = delete a.y;
const c = [ "before ", " after" ];
$( c, b );
$( b, a );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let arg = { y: 1 };
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
let tmpCalleeParam = [`before `, ` after`];
a = delete arg.y;
let tmpCalleeParam$1 = a;
$(tmpCalleeParam, a);
$(a, arg);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: ['before ', ' after'], true
 - 2: true, {}
 - eval returned: undefined
