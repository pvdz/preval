## Input

`````js filename=intro
let b = [];

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
throw (a = [b] = $([$(2)]));
$(a, b);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrElement /*:unknown*/ = $(2);
const tmpCalleeParam /*:array*/ = [tmpArrElement];
const tmpNestedAssignArrPatternRhs /*:unknown*/ = $(tmpCalleeParam);
[...tmpNestedAssignArrPatternRhs];
throw tmpNestedAssignArrPatternRhs;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrElement = $(2);
const tmpNestedAssignArrPatternRhs = $([tmpArrElement]);
[...tmpNestedAssignArrPatternRhs];
throw tmpNestedAssignArrPatternRhs;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = $( 2 );
const b = [ a ];
const c = $( b );
[ ...c ];
throw c;
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 2
 - 2: [2]
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ 2 ]>')
