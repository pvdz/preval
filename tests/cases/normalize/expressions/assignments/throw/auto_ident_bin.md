## Input

`````js filename=intro
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
throw (a = $(1) + $(2));
$(a);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const tmpBinBothLhs /*:unknown*/ = $(1);
const tmpBinBothRhs /*:unknown*/ = $(2);
const a /*:primitive*/ = tmpBinBothLhs + tmpBinBothRhs;
throw a;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
const a = $(1) + $(2);
throw a;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = $( 1 );
const b = $( 2 );
const c = a + b;
throw c;
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
const tmpBinBothLhs = $(1);
const tmpBinBothRhs = $(2);
a = tmpBinBothLhs + tmpBinBothRhs;
const tmpThrowArg = a;
throw tmpThrowArg;
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 1
 - 2: 2
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ 3 ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same
