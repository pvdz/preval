## Input

`````js filename=intro
let arg = { y: 1 };

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
throw (a = delete $(arg)[$("y")]);
$(a, arg);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const arg /*:object*/ /*truthy*/ = { y: 1 };
const tmpDeleteCompObj /*:unknown*/ = $(arg);
const tmpDeleteCompProp /*:unknown*/ = $(`y`);
const a /*:boolean*/ = delete tmpDeleteCompObj[tmpDeleteCompProp];
throw a;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpDeleteCompObj = $({ y: 1 });
const tmpDeleteCompProp = $(`y`);
const a = delete tmpDeleteCompObj[tmpDeleteCompProp];
throw a;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = { y: 1 };
const b = $( a );
const c = $( "y" );
const d = delete b[ c ];
throw d;
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let arg = { y: 1 };
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
const tmpDeleteCompObj = $(arg);
const tmpDeleteCompProp = $(`y`);
a = delete tmpDeleteCompObj[tmpDeleteCompProp];
const tmpThrowArg = a;
throw tmpThrowArg;
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: { y: '1' }
 - 2: 'y'
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ true ]>')
