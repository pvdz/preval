## Input

`````js filename=intro
let arg = { y: 1 };

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
throw (a = delete ($(1), $(2), arg)[$("y")]);
$(a, arg);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(1);
$(2);
const tmpDeleteCompProp /*:unknown*/ = $(`y`);
const arg /*:object*/ /*truthy*/ = { y: 1 };
const a /*:boolean*/ = delete arg[tmpDeleteCompProp];
throw a;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(1);
$(2);
const tmpDeleteCompProp = $(`y`);
const arg = { y: 1 };
const a = delete arg[tmpDeleteCompProp];
throw a;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 1 );
$( 2 );
const a = $( "y" );
const b = { y: 1 };
const c = delete b[ a ];
throw c;
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let arg = { y: 1 };
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
$(1);
$(2);
const tmpDeleteCompObj = arg;
const tmpDeleteCompProp = $(`y`);
a = delete tmpDeleteCompObj[tmpDeleteCompProp];
const tmpThrowArg = a;
throw tmpThrowArg;
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 1
 - 2: 2
 - 3: 'y'
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ true ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same
