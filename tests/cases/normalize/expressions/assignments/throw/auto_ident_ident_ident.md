## Input

`````js filename=intro
let b = 1,
  c = 2;

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
throw (a = b = 2);
$(a, b, c);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
throw 2;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
throw 2;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
throw 2;
`````


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ 2 ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
