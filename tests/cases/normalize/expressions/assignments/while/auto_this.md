## Input

`````js filename=intro
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
while ((a = this)) $(100);
$(a);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(undefined);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(undefined);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( undefined );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
while (true) {
  a = undefined;
  const tmpIfTest = a;
  if (tmpIfTest) {
    $(100);
  } else {
    break;
  }
}
$(a);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) do we want to support ObjectExpression as expression statement in free loops?


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: undefined
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
