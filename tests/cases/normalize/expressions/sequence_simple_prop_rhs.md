## Input

`````js filename=intro
let a = 0, b = 1, c = {x: {y: 10}};
a = 'Identifier' === ((b = c.x), b).y;
$(a);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(false);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(false);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( false );
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: false
 - eval returned: undefined
