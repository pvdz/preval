## Input

`````js filename=intro
let b = { x: 1 },
  c = 3;

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
[...(b.x = b.x = b.x = b.x = b.x = b.x = c)];
$(a, b, c);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`[...3];\`)`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`[...3];\`)`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
throw "Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by `[...3];`)";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let b = { x: 1 };
let c = 3;
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
const tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$9 = c;
b.x = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$9;
const tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$7 = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$9;
b.x = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$7;
const tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$5 = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$7;
b.x = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$5;
const tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$3 = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$5;
b.x = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$3;
const tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$1 = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$3;
b.x = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$1;
const tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs$1;
b.x = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs;
const tmpArrElToSpread = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs;
[...tmpArrElToSpread];
$(a, b, c);
`````

None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')
