## Input

`````js filename=intro
let b = { c: 1 };

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
[...((1, 2, b).c = 2)];
$(a, b);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`[...2];\`)`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`[...2];\`)`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
throw "Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by `[...2];`)";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let b = { c: 1 };
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
const tmpInitAssignLhsComputedObj = b;
const tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs = 2;
tmpInitAssignLhsComputedObj.c = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs;
const tmpArrElToSpread = tmpInitAssignLhsComputedRhs;
[...tmpArrElToSpread];
$(a, b);
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same
