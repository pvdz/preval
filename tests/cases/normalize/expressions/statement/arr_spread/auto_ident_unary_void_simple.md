## Input

`````js filename=intro
let arg = 1;

let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
[...void arg];
$(a, arg);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`[...undefined];\`)`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`[...undefined];\`)`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
throw "Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by `[...undefined];`)";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let arg = 1;
let a = { a: 999, b: 1000 };
const tmpArrElToSpread = undefined;
[...tmpArrElToSpread];
$(a, arg);
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
