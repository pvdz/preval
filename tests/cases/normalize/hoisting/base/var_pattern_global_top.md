## Input

`````js filename=intro
$(x);
var [x] = [10];
$(x);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(undefined);
$(10);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(undefined);
$(10);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( undefined );
$( 10 );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: undefined
 - 2: 10
 - eval returned: undefined
