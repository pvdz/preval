> Function declarations are hoisted and will be initialized at the start of a function. So they should be moved to the very top. Even above var decls of the same name, if any. Their order should not matter.

## Input

`````js filename=intro
$(f(1));
function f() { return $(2); }
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const tmpCalleeParam /*:unknown*/ = $(2);
$(tmpCalleeParam);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$($(2));
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = $( 2 );
$( a );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let f = function () {
  debugger;
  const tmpReturnArg = $(2);
  return tmpReturnArg;
};
let tmpCalleeParam = f(1);
$(tmpCalleeParam);
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 2
 - 2: 2
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same
