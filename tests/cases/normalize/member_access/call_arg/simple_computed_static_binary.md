## Input

`````js filename=intro
const obj = {foo: 10};
$(obj['fo' + 'o']);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(10);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(10);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 10 );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const obj = { foo: 10 };
const tmpCompObj = obj;
const tmpCalleeParam$1 = `foo`;
let tmpCalleeParam = tmpCompObj[tmpCalleeParam$1];
$(tmpCalleeParam);
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 10
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
