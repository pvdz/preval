There are a few things that make the assignment case different from param and binding patterns.

- Assignment allows member expressions as well, which introduce arbitrary expressions in the mix
  - `[$().foo] = obj`
- The existing root node is a regular assignment so we can't lean on the same trick as before, which means that we have to work with fresh `var` bindings and expand into a set of assignments rather than statements or bindings. If the context allows then other steps might still normalize it to individual statements.

## Input

`````js filename=intro
let x = 10;
([ x ] = [ 100 ]);
$(x);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(100);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(100);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 100 );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 100
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
