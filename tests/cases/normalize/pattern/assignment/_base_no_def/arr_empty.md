There are a few things that make the assignment case different from param and binding patterns.

- Assignment allows member expressions as well, which introduce arbitrary expressions in the mix
  - `[$().foo] = obj`
- The existing root node is a regular assignment so we can't lean on the same trick as before, which means that we have to work with fresh `var` bindings and expand into a set of assignments rather than statements or bindings. If the context allows then other steps might still normalize it to individual statements.

## Input

`````js filename=intro
([ ] = 1);
`````

## Normalized

`````js filename=intro
var arrAssignPatternRhs;
var arrPatternSplat;
arrAssignPatternRhs = 1;
arrPatternSplat = [...arrAssignPatternRhs];
`````

## Uniformed

`````js filename=intro
var x;
var x;
x = 8;
x = [...x];
`````

## Output

`````js filename=intro
var arrAssignPatternRhs;
var arrPatternSplat;
arrAssignPatternRhs = 1;
arrPatternSplat = [...arrAssignPatternRhs];
`````
