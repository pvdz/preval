## Input

`````js filename=intro
([[x = $('fail')]] = 1); // Crash expected
$('bad');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...1];\`)`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...1];\`)`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
throw "Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by `const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...1];`)";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrAssignPatternRhs = 1;
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpArrAssignPatternRhs];
const tmpArrPatternStep = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
const tmpArrPatternSplat$1 = [...tmpArrPatternStep];
const tmpAPBD = tmpArrPatternSplat$1[0];
const tmpIfTest = tmpAPBD === undefined;
if (tmpIfTest) {
  x = $(`fail`);
  $(`bad`);
} else {
  x = tmpAPBD;
  $(`bad`);
}
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
