## Input

`````js filename=intro
let x = 100;
([[...x]] = [[]]);
$(x);
`````

## Pre Normal


`````js filename=intro
let x = 100;
[[...x]] = [[]];
$(x);
`````

## Normalized


`````js filename=intro
let x = 100;
const tmpArrElement = [];
const arrAssignPatternRhs = [tmpArrElement];
const arrPatternSplat = [...arrAssignPatternRhs];
const arrPatternStep = arrPatternSplat[0];
const arrPatternSplat$1 = [...arrPatternStep];
x = arrPatternSplat$1.slice(0);
$(x);
`````

## Output


`````js filename=intro
const tmpClusterSSA_x /*:array*/ = [];
$(tmpClusterSSA_x);
`````

## PST Output

With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = [];
$( a );
`````

## Globals

None

## Result

Should call `$` with:
 - 1: []
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Final output calls: Same

Todos triggered:
- we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- type trackeed tricks can possibly support resolving the type for calling this builtin symbol: $array_slice
