## Input

`````js filename=intro
([[...x]] = 'abc');
$(x);
`````

## Pre Normal


`````js filename=intro
[[...x]] = `abc`;
$(x);
`````

## Normalized


`````js filename=intro
const arrAssignPatternRhs = `abc`;
const arrPatternSplat = [...arrAssignPatternRhs];
const arrPatternStep = arrPatternSplat[0];
const arrPatternSplat$1 = [...arrPatternStep];
x = arrPatternSplat$1.slice(0);
$(x);
`````

## Output


`````js filename=intro
x = [`a`];
$(x);
`````

## PST Output

With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
x = [ "a" ];
$( x );
`````

## Globals

BAD@! Found 1 implicit global bindings:

x

## Result

Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not defined ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Final output calls: Same

Todos triggered:
- we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
