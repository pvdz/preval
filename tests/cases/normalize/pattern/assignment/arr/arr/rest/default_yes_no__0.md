## Input

`````js filename=intro
([[...x] = $('fail')] = 0);
$('bad');
`````

## Settled


`````js filename=intro
[...0];
throw `[Preval]: Array spread must crash before this line`;
`````

## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
[...0];
throw `[Preval]: Array spread must crash before this line`;
`````

## Pre Normal


`````js filename=intro
[[...x] = $(`fail`)] = 0;
$(`bad`);
`````

## Normalized


`````js filename=intro
const arrAssignPatternRhs = 0;
const arrPatternSplat = [...arrAssignPatternRhs];
const arrPatternBeforeDefault = arrPatternSplat[0];
let arrPatternStep = undefined;
const tmpIfTest = arrPatternBeforeDefault === undefined;
if (tmpIfTest) {
  arrPatternStep = $(`fail`);
} else {
  arrPatternStep = arrPatternBeforeDefault;
}
const arrPatternSplat$1 = [...arrPatternStep];
x = arrPatternSplat$1.slice(0);
$(`bad`);
`````

## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
[ ...0 ];
throw "[Preval]: Array spread must crash before this line";
`````

## Globals

None

## Runtime Outcome

Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same

Todos triggered:
- we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- type trackeed tricks can possibly support resolving the type for calling this builtin symbol: $array_slice
