## Input

`````js filename=intro
([[...x] = $('fail')] = 1); // Expect to crash
$('bad');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
[...1];
throw `[Preval]: Array spread must crash before this line`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
[...1];
throw `[Preval]: Array spread must crash before this line`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
[ ...1 ];
throw "[Preval]: Array spread must crash before this line";
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- (todo) inline computed array property read
- (todo) replace with $array_slice
- (todo) type trackeed tricks can possibly support method $array_slice


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same
