## Input

`````js filename=intro
([] = 1); // Expecting to crash
$('bad');
`````

## Pre Normal


`````js filename=intro
[] = 1;
$(`bad`);
`````

## Normalized


`````js filename=intro
const arrAssignPatternRhs = 1;
const arrPatternSplat = [...arrAssignPatternRhs];
$(`bad`);
`````

## Output


`````js filename=intro
[...1];
throw `[Preval]: Array spread must crash before this line`;
`````

## PST Output

With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
[ ... 1 ];
throw "[Preval]: Array spread must crash before this line";
`````

## Globals

None

## Result

Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Final output calls: Same
