## Input

`````js filename=intro
([x] = 0);
$('bad');
`````

## Normalized

`````js filename=intro
const arrAssignPatternRhs = 0;
const arrPatternSplat = [...arrAssignPatternRhs];
x = arrPatternSplat[0];
$('bad');
`````

## Output

`````js filename=intro
'<skipped>';
`````

## Result

Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Normalized calls: Same

Final output calls: BAD!!
 - eval returned: undefined
