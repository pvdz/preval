## Input

`````js filename=intro
([{}] = [null, 20, 30]);
$('ok');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
null.cannotDestructureThis;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
null.cannotDestructureThis;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
null.cannotDestructureThis;
throw "[Preval]: Can not reach here";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrAssignPatternRhs = [null, 20, 30];
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpArrAssignPatternRhs];
const tmpArrPatternStep = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
let tmpObjPatternCrashTest = tmpArrPatternStep === undefined;
if (tmpObjPatternCrashTest) {
} else {
  tmpObjPatternCrashTest = tmpArrPatternStep === null;
}
if (tmpObjPatternCrashTest) {
  tmpObjPatternCrashTest = tmpArrPatternStep.cannotDestructureThis;
  $(`ok`);
} else {
  $(`ok`);
}
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
