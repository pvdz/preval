## Input

`````js filename=intro
([{} = $('fail')] = ['abc', 20, 30]);
$('ok');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "ok" );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrAssignPatternRhs = [`abc`, 20, 30];
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpArrAssignPatternRhs];
const tmpAPBD = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
let tmpArrPatternStep = undefined;
const tmpIfTest = tmpAPBD === undefined;
if (tmpIfTest) {
  tmpArrPatternStep = $(`fail`);
} else {
  tmpArrPatternStep = tmpAPBD;
}
let tmpObjPatternCrashTest = tmpArrPatternStep === undefined;
if (tmpObjPatternCrashTest) {
} else {
  tmpObjPatternCrashTest = tmpArrPatternStep === null;
}
if (tmpObjPatternCrashTest) {
  tmpObjPatternCrashTest = tmpArrPatternStep.cannotDestructureThis;
  $(`ok`);
} else {
  $(`ok`);
}
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'ok'
 - eval returned: undefined
