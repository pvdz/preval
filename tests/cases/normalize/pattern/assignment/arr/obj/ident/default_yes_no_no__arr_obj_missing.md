## Input

`````js filename=intro
([{ x = $('pass') }] = [{ y: 2, z: 3 }, 20, 30]);
$(x);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const tmpOPBD /*:unknown*/ = $Object_prototype.x;
const tmpIfTest /*:boolean*/ = tmpOPBD === undefined;
if (tmpIfTest) {
  x = $(`pass`);
  $(x);
} else {
  x = tmpOPBD;
  $(tmpOPBD);
}
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpOPBD = $Object_prototype.x;
if (tmpOPBD === undefined) {
  x = $(`pass`);
  $(x);
} else {
  x = tmpOPBD;
  $(tmpOPBD);
}
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = $Object_prototype.x;
const b = a === undefined;
if (b) {
  x = $( "pass" );
  $( x );
}
else {
  x = a;
  $( a );
}
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) can we always safely clone ident refs in this case?
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


BAD@! Found 1 implicit global bindings:

x


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'pass'
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not defined ]>')
