## Input

`````js filename=intro
([
  {
    x: {
      y: [],
    },
  },
] = [{ x: { x: 13, y: [1, 2, 3], z: 31 }, y: 11 }, 10]);
$('ok');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "ok" );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpObjLitVal$1 = 13;
const tmpObjLitVal$3 = [1, 2, 3];
const tmpObjLitVal = { x: tmpObjLitVal$1, y: tmpObjLitVal$3, z: 31 };
const tmpArrElement = { x: tmpObjLitVal, y: 11 };
const tmpArrAssignPatternRhs = [tmpArrElement, 10];
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpArrAssignPatternRhs];
const tmpArrPatternStep = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
const tmpOPND = tmpArrPatternStep.x;
const tmpOPND$1 = tmpOPND.y;
const tmpArrPatternSplat$1 = [...tmpOPND$1];
$(`ok`);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) array reads var statement with init ObjectExpression
- (todo) can we always safely clone ident refs in this case?
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'ok'
 - eval returned: undefined
