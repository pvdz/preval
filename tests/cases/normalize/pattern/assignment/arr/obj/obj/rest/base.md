## Input

`````js filename=intro
([
  {
    x: { ...y },
  },
] = [{ x: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }, y: 11 }, 10]);
$(y);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const tmpObjLitVal /*:object*/ = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const tmpCalleeParam$1 /*:array*/ = [];
y = $objPatternRest(tmpObjLitVal, tmpCalleeParam$1, undefined);
$(y);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
y = $objPatternRest({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }, [], undefined);
$(y);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3,
};
const b = [];
y = $objPatternRest( a, b, undefined );
$( y );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) can we always safely clone ident refs in this case?
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


BAD@! Found 1 implicit global bindings:

y


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not defined ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same
