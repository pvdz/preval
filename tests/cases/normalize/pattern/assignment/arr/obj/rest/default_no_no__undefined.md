## Input

`````js filename=intro
([{ ...x }] = undefined);
$(x);
`````

## Settled


`````js filename=intro
[...undefined];
throw `[Preval]: Array spread must crash before this line`;
`````

## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
[...undefined];
throw `[Preval]: Array spread must crash before this line`;
`````

## Pre Normal


`````js filename=intro
[{ ...x }] = undefined;
$(x);
`````

## Normalized


`````js filename=intro
const arrAssignPatternRhs = undefined;
const arrPatternSplat = [...arrAssignPatternRhs];
const arrPatternStep = arrPatternSplat[0];
const tmpCalleeParam = arrPatternStep;
const tmpCalleeParam$1 = [];
x = objPatternRest(tmpCalleeParam, tmpCalleeParam$1, undefined);
$(x);
`````

## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
[ ...undefined ];
throw "[Preval]: Array spread must crash before this line";
`````

## Globals

None

## Runtime Outcome

Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same

Todos triggered:
- we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
