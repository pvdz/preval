## Input

`````js filename=intro
([{ ...x } = $({ a: 'fail' })] = 0);
$('bad');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...0];\`)`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...0];\`)`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
throw "Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by `const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...0];`)";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrAssignPatternRhs = 0;
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpArrAssignPatternRhs];
const tmpAPBD = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
let tmpArrPatternStep = undefined;
const tmpIfTest = tmpAPBD === undefined;
if (tmpIfTest) {
  let tmpCalleeParam = { a: `fail` };
  tmpArrPatternStep = $(tmpCalleeParam);
} else {
  tmpArrPatternStep = tmpAPBD;
}
let tmpCalleeParam$1 = tmpArrPatternStep;
let tmpCalleeParam$3 = [];
x = $objPatternRest(tmpCalleeParam$1, tmpCalleeParam$3, undefined);
$(`bad`);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same
