> By normalizing patterns we don't have to concern ourselves with its complexities. Defaults are another dimension to take care off and test for.

## Input

`````js filename=intro
({ x: [] } = { x: [1, 2, 3], a: 11, b: 12 });
$('ok');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "ok" );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpObjLitVal = [1, 2, 3];
const tmpAssignObjPatternRhs = { x: tmpObjLitVal, a: 11, b: 12 };
const tmpOPND = tmpAssignObjPatternRhs.x;
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpOPND];
$(`ok`);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) array reads var statement with init ObjectExpression
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'ok'
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same
