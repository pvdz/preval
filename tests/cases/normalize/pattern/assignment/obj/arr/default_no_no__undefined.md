## Input

`````js filename=intro
({ x: [] } = undefined);
$('bad');
`````

## Settled


`````js filename=intro
undefined.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````

## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
undefined.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````

## Pre Normal


`````js filename=intro
({
  x: [],
} = undefined);
$(`bad`);
`````

## Normalized


`````js filename=intro
const tmpAssignObjPatternRhs = undefined;
const objPatternNoDefault = tmpAssignObjPatternRhs.x;
const arrPatternSplat = [...objPatternNoDefault];
$(`bad`);
`````

## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
undefined.x;
throw "[Preval]: Can not reach here";
`````

## Globals

None

## Runtime Outcome

Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ Cannot read property <ref> of <ref2> ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
