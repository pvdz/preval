## Input

`````js filename=intro
({ x: [] = $(['fail']) } = { x: null, a: 11, b: 12 });
$('bad');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`[...null];\`)`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`[...null];\`)`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
throw "Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by `[...null];`)";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpAssignObjPatternRhs = { x: null, a: 11, b: 12 };
const tmpOPBD = tmpAssignObjPatternRhs.x;
let tmpOPAD = undefined;
const tmpIfTest = tmpOPBD === undefined;
if (tmpIfTest) {
  let tmpCalleeParam = [`fail`];
  tmpOPAD = $(tmpCalleeParam);
} else {
  tmpOPAD = tmpOPBD;
}
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpOPAD];
$(`bad`);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same
