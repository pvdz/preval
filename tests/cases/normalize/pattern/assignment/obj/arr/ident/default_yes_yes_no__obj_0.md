## Input

`````js filename=intro
({ x: [y = 'fail'] = $(['fail2']) } = { x: 0, a: 11, b: 12 });
$('bad');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...0];\`)`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...0];\`)`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
throw "Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by `const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...0];`)";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpAssignObjPatternRhs = { x: 0, a: 11, b: 12 };
const tmpOPBD = tmpAssignObjPatternRhs.x;
let tmpOPAD = undefined;
const tmpIfTest = tmpOPBD === undefined;
if (tmpIfTest) {
  let tmpCalleeParam = [`fail2`];
  tmpOPAD = $(tmpCalleeParam);
} else {
  tmpOPAD = tmpOPBD;
}
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpOPAD];
const tmpAPBD = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
const tmpIfTest$1 = tmpAPBD === undefined;
if (tmpIfTest$1) {
  y = `fail`;
  $(`bad`);
} else {
  y = tmpAPBD;
  $(`bad`);
}
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same
