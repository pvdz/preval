## Input

`````js filename=intro
({ x: [...y] } = null);
$('bad');
`````

## Settled


`````js filename=intro
null.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````

## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
null.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````

## Pre Normal


`````js filename=intro
({
  x: [...y],
} = null);
$(`bad`);
`````

## Normalized


`````js filename=intro
const tmpAssignObjPatternRhs = null;
const objPatternNoDefault = tmpAssignObjPatternRhs.x;
const arrPatternSplat = [...objPatternNoDefault];
y = arrPatternSplat.slice(0);
$(`bad`);
`````

## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
null.x;
throw "[Preval]: Can not reach here";
`````

## Globals

None

## Runtime Outcome

Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same

Todos triggered:
- type trackeed tricks can possibly support resolving the type for calling this builtin method symbol: $array_slice
