## Input

`````js filename=intro
({
  x: {
    y: [],
  },
} = { x: { x: 13, y: [1, 2, 3], z: 14 }, b: 11, c: 12 });
$('ok');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "ok" );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpObjLitVal$1 = 13;
const tmpObjLitVal$3 = [1, 2, 3];
const tmpObjLitVal = { x: tmpObjLitVal$1, y: tmpObjLitVal$3, z: 14 };
const tmpAssignObjPatternRhs = { x: tmpObjLitVal, b: 11, c: 12 };
const tmpOPND = tmpAssignObjPatternRhs.x;
const tmpOPND$1 = tmpOPND.y;
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpOPND$1];
$(`ok`);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) array reads var statement with init ObjectExpression
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'ok'
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same
