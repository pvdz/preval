## Input

`````js filename=intro
({ x: {} } = null);
$('bad');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
null.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
null.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
null.x;
throw "[Preval]: Can not reach here";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpAssignObjPatternRhs = null;
const tmpOPND = tmpAssignObjPatternRhs.x;
let tmpObjPatternCrashTest = tmpOPND === undefined;
if (tmpObjPatternCrashTest) {
} else {
  tmpObjPatternCrashTest = tmpOPND === null;
}
if (tmpObjPatternCrashTest) {
  tmpObjPatternCrashTest = tmpOPND.cannotDestructureThis;
  $(`bad`);
} else {
  $(`bad`);
}
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same
