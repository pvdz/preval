Confirm that both references of `x` get a unique name.

In particular, the pattern's "y" should be replaced with a different name.

## Input

`````js filename=intro
{ let a = 1; }
const { x: a } = 1
{ let a = 1; }
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$Number_prototype.x;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$Number_prototype.x;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$Number_prototype.x;
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same
