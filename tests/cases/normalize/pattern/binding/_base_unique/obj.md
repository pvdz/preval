## Input

`````js filename=intro
{ let x = 1; }
const { x } = 1;
{ let x = 1; }
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$Number_prototype.x;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$Number_prototype.x;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$Number_prototype.x;
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let x$1 = 1;
const tmpBindingPatternObjRoot = 1;
const x = tmpBindingPatternObjRoot.x;
let x$3 = 1;
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
