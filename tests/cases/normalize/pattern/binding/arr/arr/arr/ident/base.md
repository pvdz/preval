> By normalizing patterns we don't have to concern ourselves with its complexities. Defaults are another dimension to take care off and test for.

## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [[[x]]] = [[[[1, 2, 3], 4, 5], 20, 30], 40, 50];
$(x);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrElement$3 /*:array*/ = [1, 2, 3];
$(tmpArrElement$3);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$([1, 2, 3]);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
$( a );
`````


## Todos triggered


- we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- inline computed array property read


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: [1, 2, 3]
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
