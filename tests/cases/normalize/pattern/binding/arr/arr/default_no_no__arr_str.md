## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [[]] = ['abc', 4, 5];
$('ok');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "ok" );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpBindingPatternArrRoot = [`abc`, 4, 5];
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpBindingPatternArrRoot];
const tmpArrPatternStep = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
const tmpArrPatternSplat$1 = [...tmpArrPatternStep];
$(`ok`);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'ok'
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
