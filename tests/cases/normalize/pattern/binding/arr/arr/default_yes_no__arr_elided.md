## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [[] = $(['pass2'])] = [, , , , 4, 5];
$('ok');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const tmpCalleeParam /*:array*/ = [`pass2`];
const tmpArrPatternStep /*:unknown*/ = $(tmpCalleeParam);
[...tmpArrPatternStep];
$(`ok`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrPatternStep = $([`pass2`]);
[...tmpArrPatternStep];
$(`ok`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = [ "pass2" ];
const b = $( a );
[ ...b ];
$( "ok" );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: ['pass2']
 - 2: 'ok'
 - eval returned: undefined
