## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [
  [
    {
      x: [],
    },
  ],
] = [[{ x: [1, 2, 3] }, 20, 30], 40, 50];
$('ok');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "ok" );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpObjLitVal = [1, 2, 3];
const tmpArrElement$1 = { x: tmpObjLitVal };
const tmpArrElement = [tmpArrElement$1, 20, 30];
const tmpBindingPatternArrRoot = [tmpArrElement, 40, 50];
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpBindingPatternArrRoot];
const tmpArrPatternStep = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
const tmpArrPatternSplat$1 = [...tmpArrPatternStep];
const tmpArrPatternStep$1 = tmpArrPatternSplat$1[0];
const tmpOPND = tmpArrPatternStep$1.x;
const tmpArrPatternSplat$3 = [...tmpOPND];
$(`ok`);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) can we always safely clone ident refs in this case?
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) support array reads statement type VarStatement
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'ok'
 - eval returned: undefined
