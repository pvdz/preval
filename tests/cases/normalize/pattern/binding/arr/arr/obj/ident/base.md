## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [[{ x }]] = [[{ x: 1 }, 20, 30], 40, 50];
$(x);
`````

## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````

## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````

## Pre Normal


`````js filename=intro
const [[{ x: x }]] = [[{ x: 1 }, 20, 30], 40, 50];
$(x);
`````

## Normalized


`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrElement$1 = { x: 1 };
const tmpArrElement = [tmpArrElement$1, 20, 30];
const bindingPatternArrRoot = [tmpArrElement, 40, 50];
const arrPatternSplat = [...bindingPatternArrRoot];
const arrPatternStep = arrPatternSplat[0];
const arrPatternSplat$1 = [...arrPatternStep];
const arrPatternStep$1 = arrPatternSplat$1[0];
const x = arrPatternStep$1.x;
$(x);
`````

## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 1 );
`````

## Globals

None

## Runtime Outcome

Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 1
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same

Todos triggered:
- we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
