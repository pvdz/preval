## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [[{ x }]] = [[{ x: 1 }, 20, 30], 40, 50];
$(x);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 1 );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrElement$1 = { x: 1 };
const tmpArrElement = [tmpArrElement$1, 20, 30];
const tmpBindingPatternArrRoot = [tmpArrElement, 40, 50];
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpBindingPatternArrRoot];
const tmpArrPatternStep = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
const tmpArrPatternSplat$1 = [...tmpArrPatternStep];
const tmpArrPatternStep$1 = tmpArrPatternSplat$1[0];
const x = tmpArrPatternStep$1.x;
$(x);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) can we always safely clone ident refs in this case?
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 1
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
