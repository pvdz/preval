## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [[...x]] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
$(x);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`const tmpArrPatternSplat\$1 = [...1];\`)`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`const tmpArrPatternSplat\$1 = [...1];\`)`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
throw "Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by `const tmpArrPatternSplat$1 = [...1];`)";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpBindingPatternArrRoot = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpBindingPatternArrRoot];
const tmpArrPatternStep = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
const tmpArrPatternSplat$1 = [...tmpArrPatternStep];
const tmpMCF = tmpArrPatternSplat$1.slice;
const x = $dotCall(tmpMCF, tmpArrPatternSplat$1, `slice`, 0);
$(x);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) access object property that also exists on prototype? $array_slice
- (todo) type trackeed tricks can possibly support static $array_slice
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
