## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [[...x]] = [undefined, 4, 5];
$(x);
`````

## Pre Normal


`````js filename=intro
const [[...x]] = [undefined, 4, 5];
$(x);
`````

## Normalized


`````js filename=intro
const bindingPatternArrRoot = [undefined, 4, 5];
const arrPatternSplat = [...bindingPatternArrRoot];
const arrPatternStep = arrPatternSplat[0];
const arrPatternSplat$1 = [...arrPatternStep];
const x = arrPatternSplat$1.slice(0);
$(x);
`````

## Output


`````js filename=intro
[...undefined];
throw `[Preval]: Array spread must crash before this line`;
`````

## PST Output

With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
[ ...undefined ];
throw "[Preval]: Array spread must crash before this line";
`````

## Globals

None

## Result

Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Final output calls: Same

Todos triggered:
- we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- type trackeed tricks can possibly support resolving the type for calling this builtin symbol: $array_slice
