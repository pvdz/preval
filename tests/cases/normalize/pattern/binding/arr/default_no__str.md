## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [] = 'xyz';
$('ok');
`````

## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````

## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````

## Pre Normal


`````js filename=intro
const [] = `xyz`;
$(`ok`);
`````

## Normalized


`````js filename=intro
const bindingPatternArrRoot = `xyz`;
const arrPatternSplat = [...bindingPatternArrRoot];
$(`ok`);
`````

## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "ok" );
`````

## Globals

None

## Runtime Outcome

Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'ok'
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
