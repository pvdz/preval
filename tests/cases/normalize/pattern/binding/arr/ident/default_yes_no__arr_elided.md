## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [x = $('pass')] = [, , 1];
$(x);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const tmpClusterSSA_x /*:unknown*/ = $(`pass`);
$(tmpClusterSSA_x);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$($(`pass`));
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = $( "pass" );
$( a );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'pass'
 - 2: 'pass'
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
