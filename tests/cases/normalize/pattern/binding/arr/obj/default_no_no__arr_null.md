## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [{}] = [null, 20, 30];
$('ok');
`````

## Settled


`````js filename=intro
null.cannotDestructureThis;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````

## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
null.cannotDestructureThis;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````

## Pre Normal


`````js filename=intro
const [{}] = [null, 20, 30];
$(`ok`);
`````

## Normalized


`````js filename=intro
const bindingPatternArrRoot = [null, 20, 30];
const arrPatternSplat = [...bindingPatternArrRoot];
const arrPatternStep = arrPatternSplat[0];
let objPatternCrashTest = arrPatternStep === undefined;
if (objPatternCrashTest) {
} else {
  objPatternCrashTest = arrPatternStep === null;
}
if (objPatternCrashTest) {
  objPatternCrashTest = arrPatternStep.cannotDestructureThis;
  $(`ok`);
} else {
  $(`ok`);
}
`````

## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
null.cannotDestructureThis;
throw "[Preval]: Can not reach here";
`````

## Globals

None

## Runtime Outcome

Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same

Todos triggered:
- we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- inline computed array property read
