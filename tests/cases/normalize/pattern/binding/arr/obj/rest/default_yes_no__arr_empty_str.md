## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [{ ...x } = $({ a: 'fail' })] = ['', 20, 30];
$(x);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const tmpCalleeParam$3 /*:array*/ = [];
const x /*:unknown*/ = $objPatternRest(``, tmpCalleeParam$3, undefined);
$(x);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$($objPatternRest(``, [], undefined));
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = [];
const b = $objPatternRest( "", a, undefined );
$( b );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) support array reads statement type VarStatement


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: {}
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same
