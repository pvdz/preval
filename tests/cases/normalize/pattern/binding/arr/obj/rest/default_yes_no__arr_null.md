## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [{ ...x } = $({ a: 'fail' })] = [null, 20, 30];
$('bad');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const tmpCalleeParam$3 /*:array*/ = [];
$objPatternRest(null, tmpCalleeParam$3, undefined);
$(`bad`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$objPatternRest(null, [], undefined);
$(`bad`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = [];
$objPatternRest( null, a, undefined );
$( "bad" );
`````


## Todos triggered


- we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- inline computed array property read


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
