## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [...x] = [1, 2, 3];
$(x);
`````

## Normalized

`````js filename=intro
const bindingPatternArrRoot = [1, 2, 3];
const arrPatternSplat = [...bindingPatternArrRoot];
const x = arrPatternSplat.slice(0);
$(x);
`````

## Output

`````js filename=intro
'<skipped>';
`````

## Result

Should call `$` with:
 - 1: [1, 2, 3]
 - eval returned: undefined

Normalized calls: Same

Final output calls: BAD!!
 - eval returned: undefined
