## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [...x] = [];
$(x);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const x /*:array*/ = [];
$(x);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$([]);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = [];
$( a );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) access object property that also exists on prototype? $array_slice
- (todo) arr mutation may be able to inline this method: tmpMCF


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: []
 - eval returned: undefined
