## Input

`````js filename=intro
const [...x] = 'abc';
$(x);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const x /*:array*/ /*truthy*/ = [`a`, `b`, `c`];
$(x);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$([`a`, `b`, `c`]);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = [ "a", "b", "c" ];
$( a );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpBindingPatternArrRoot = `abc`;
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpBindingPatternArrRoot];
const tmpMCF = tmpArrPatternSplat.slice;
const x = $dotCall(tmpMCF, tmpArrPatternSplat, `slice`, 0);
$(x);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) access object property that also exists on prototype? $array_slice
- (todo) arr mutation may be able to inline this method: tmpMCF
- (todo) array reads var statement with init CallExpression
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) type trackeed tricks can possibly support static $array_slice


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: ['a', 'b', 'c']
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same
