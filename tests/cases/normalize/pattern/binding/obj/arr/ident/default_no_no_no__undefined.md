## Input

`````js filename=intro
const { x: [y] } = undefined;
$('bad');
`````

## Settled


`````js filename=intro
undefined.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````

## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
undefined.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````

## Pre Normal


`````js filename=intro
const {
  x: [y],
} = undefined;
$(`bad`);
`````

## Normalized


`````js filename=intro
const bindingPatternObjRoot = undefined;
const objPatternNoDefault = bindingPatternObjRoot.x;
const arrPatternSplat = [...objPatternNoDefault];
const y = arrPatternSplat[0];
$(`bad`);
`````

## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
undefined.x;
throw "[Preval]: Can not reach here";
`````

## Globals

None

## Runtime Outcome

Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same

Todos triggered:
- we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- inline computed array property read
