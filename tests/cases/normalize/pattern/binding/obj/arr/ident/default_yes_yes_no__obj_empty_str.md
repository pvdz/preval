## Input

`````js filename=intro
const { x: [y = 'pass'] = $(['fail2']) } = { x: '', a: 11, b: 12 };
$(y);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`pass`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`pass`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "pass" );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'pass'
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
