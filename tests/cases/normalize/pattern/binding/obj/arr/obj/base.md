> By normalizing patterns we don't have to concern ourselves with its complexities. Defaults are another dimension to take care off and test for.

## Input

`````js filename=intro
const { x: [{}] } = { x: [{ x: 1, y: 2, c: 3 }, 13, 14], a: 11, b: 12 };
$('ok');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "ok" );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrElement = { x: 1, y: 2, c: 3 };
const tmpObjLitVal = [tmpArrElement, 13, 14];
const tmpBindingPatternObjRoot = { x: tmpObjLitVal, a: 11, b: 12 };
const tmpOPND = tmpBindingPatternObjRoot.x;
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpOPND];
const tmpArrPatternStep = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
let tmpObjPatternCrashTest = tmpArrPatternStep === undefined;
if (tmpObjPatternCrashTest) {
} else {
  tmpObjPatternCrashTest = tmpArrPatternStep === null;
}
if (tmpObjPatternCrashTest) {
  tmpObjPatternCrashTest = tmpArrPatternStep.cannotDestructureThis;
  $(`ok`);
} else {
  $(`ok`);
}
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) array reads var statement with init ObjectExpression
- (todo) can we always safely clone ident refs in this case?
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'ok'
 - eval returned: undefined
