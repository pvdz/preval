## Input

`````js filename=intro
const { x: [{ ...y }] } = { x: [{ x: 1, y: 2, c: 3 }, 13, 14], a: 11, b: 12 };
$(y);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrElement /*:object*/ = { x: 1, y: 2, c: 3 };
const tmpCalleeParam$1 /*:array*/ = [];
const y /*:unknown*/ = $objPatternRest(tmpArrElement, tmpCalleeParam$1, undefined);
$(y);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrElement = { x: 1, y: 2, c: 3 };
$($objPatternRest(tmpArrElement, [], undefined));
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = {
  x: 1,
  y: 2,
  c: 3,
};
const b = [];
const c = $objPatternRest( a, b, undefined );
$( c );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) support array reads statement type VarStatement
- (todo) can we always safely clone ident refs in this case?


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: { x: '1', y: '2', c: '3' }
 - eval returned: undefined
