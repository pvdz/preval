## Input

`````js filename=intro
const { x: [...y] } = { x: [1, 2, 3], a: 11, b: 12 };
$(y);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const y /*:array*/ = [1, 2, 3];
$(y);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$([1, 2, 3]);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
$( a );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpObjLitVal = [1, 2, 3];
const tmpBindingPatternObjRoot = { x: tmpObjLitVal, a: 11, b: 12 };
const tmpOPND = tmpBindingPatternObjRoot.x;
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpOPND];
const tmpMCF = tmpArrPatternSplat.slice;
const y = $dotCall(tmpMCF, tmpArrPatternSplat, `slice`, 0);
$(y);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) access object property that also exists on prototype? $array_slice
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) type trackeed tricks can possibly support static $array_slice


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: [1, 2, 3]
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same
