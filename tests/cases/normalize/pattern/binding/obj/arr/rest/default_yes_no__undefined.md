## Input

`````js filename=intro
const { x: [...y] = $(['fail']) } = undefined;
$('bad');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
undefined.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
undefined.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
undefined.x;
throw "[Preval]: Can not reach here";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpBindingPatternObjRoot = undefined;
const tmpOPBD = tmpBindingPatternObjRoot.x;
let tmpOPAD = undefined;
const tmpIfTest = tmpOPBD === undefined;
if (tmpIfTest) {
  let tmpCalleeParam = [`fail`];
  tmpOPAD = $(tmpCalleeParam);
} else {
  tmpOPAD = tmpOPBD;
}
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpOPAD];
const tmpMCF = tmpArrPatternSplat.slice;
const y = $dotCall(tmpMCF, tmpArrPatternSplat, `slice`, 0);
$(`bad`);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) access object property that also exists on prototype? $array_slice
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) type trackeed tricks can possibly support static $array_slice


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')
