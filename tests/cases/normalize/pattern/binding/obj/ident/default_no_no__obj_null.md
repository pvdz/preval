## Input

`````js filename=intro
const { x } = { x: null };
$(x);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(null);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(null);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( null );
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: null
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
