> By normalizing patterns we don't have to concern ourselves with its complexities. Defaults are another dimension to take care off and test for.

## Input

`````js filename=intro
const {
  x: {
    y: [[]],
  },
} = { x: { x: 13, y: [[1, 2, 3], 15], z: 14 }, b: 11, c: 12 };
$('ok');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "ok" );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpObjLitVal$1 = 13;
const tmpArrElement = [1, 2, 3];
const tmpObjLitVal$3 = [tmpArrElement, 15];
const tmpObjLitVal = { x: tmpObjLitVal$1, y: tmpObjLitVal$3, z: 14 };
const tmpBindingPatternObjRoot = { x: tmpObjLitVal, b: 11, c: 12 };
const tmpOPND = tmpBindingPatternObjRoot.x;
const tmpOPND$1 = tmpOPND.y;
const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpOPND$1];
const tmpArrPatternStep = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
const tmpArrPatternSplat$1 = [...tmpArrPatternStep];
$(`ok`);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) can we always safely clone ident refs in this case?
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) support array reads statement type VarStatement
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'ok'
 - eval returned: undefined
