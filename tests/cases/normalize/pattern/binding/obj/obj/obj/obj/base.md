## Input

`````js filename=intro
const {
  x: {
    y: {
      z: {},
    },
  },
} = { x: { x: 13, y: { z: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }, a: 15, b: 16 }, z: 14 }, b: 11, c: 12 };
$('ok');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "ok" );
`````


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'ok'
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
