## Input

`````js filename=intro
const { x: { ...y } } = null;
$('bad');
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
null.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
null.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
null.x;
throw "[Preval]: Can not reach here";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpBindingPatternObjRoot = null;
const tmpOPND = tmpBindingPatternObjRoot.x;
let tmpCalleeParam = tmpOPND;
let tmpCalleeParam$1 = [];
const y = $objPatternRest(tmpCalleeParam, tmpCalleeParam$1, undefined);
$(`bad`);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
