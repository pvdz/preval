> Testing simple pattern normalizations. Make sure pattern bindings are properly renamed to be globally unique.

Confirm that both references of `x` get a unique name.

In particular, the pattern's "y" should be replaced with a different name.

## Input

`````js filename=intro
let y = 1;
function g({ x: y }) {
  {
    let y = 2;
  }
  return y;
}
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro

`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro

`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro

`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
