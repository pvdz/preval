## Input

`````js filename=intro
let z = 1;
function i({x: {y: {z}}}) {
  { let z = 2; }
  return z
}
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro

`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro

`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro

`````


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
