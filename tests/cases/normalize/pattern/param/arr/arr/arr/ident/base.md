## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f([[[x]]]) {
  return x;
}
$(f([[[[1, 2, 3], 4, 5], 20, 30], 40, 50], 200));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const tmpArrElement$3 /*:array*/ = [1, 2, 3];
$(tmpArrElement$3);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$([1, 2, 3]);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
$( a );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) can we always safely clone ident refs in this case?
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) support array reads statement type VarStatement
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: [1, 2, 3]
 - eval returned: undefined
