## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f([[x = $('fail')] = $(['fail2'])] = $(['fail3'])) {
  return x;
}
$(f([[1, 2, 3], 4, 5], 200));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 1 );
`````


## Todos triggered


- inline computed array property read
- we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 1
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
