## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f([[{ x }]]) {
  return x;
}
$(f([[{ x: 1 }, 20, 30], 40, 50], 200));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 1 );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let f = function ($$0) {
  const tmpParamBare = $$0;
  debugger;
  let tmpBindingPatternArrRoot = tmpParamBare;
  let tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpBindingPatternArrRoot];
  let tmpArrPatternStep = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
  let tmpArrPatternSplat$1 = [...tmpArrPatternStep];
  let tmpArrPatternStep$1 = tmpArrPatternSplat$1[0];
  let x = tmpArrPatternStep$1.x;
  return x;
};
const tmpCallCallee = f;
const tmpArrElement$1 = { x: 1 };
const tmpArrElement = [tmpArrElement$1, 20, 30];
let tmpCalleeParam$1 = [tmpArrElement, 40, 50];
let tmpCalleeParam = f(tmpCalleeParam$1, 200);
$(tmpCalleeParam);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) array reads var statement with init ArrayExpression
- (todo) array reads var statement with init CallExpression
- (todo) array reads var statement with init MemberExpression
- (todo) can we always safely clone ident refs in this case?
- (todo) support Identifier as var init in let_hoisting noob check
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 1
 - eval returned: undefined
