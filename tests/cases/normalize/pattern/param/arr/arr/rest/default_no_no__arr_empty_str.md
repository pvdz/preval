## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f([[...x]]) {
  return x;
}
$(f(['', 4, 5], 200));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const x /*:array*/ = [];
$(x);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$([]);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = [];
$( a );
`````


## Todos triggered


- inline computed array property read
- replace with $array_slice
- we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- type trackeed tricks can possibly support resolving the type for calling this builtin method symbol: $array_slice


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: []
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same
