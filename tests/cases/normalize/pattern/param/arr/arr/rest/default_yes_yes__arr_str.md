## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f([[...x] = $('fail')] = $('fail2')) {
  return x;
}
$(f(['abc', 4, 5], 200));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const x /*:array*/ = [`a`, `b`, `c`];
$(x);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$([`a`, `b`, `c`]);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = [ "a", "b", "c" ];
$( a );
`````


## Todos triggered


- inline computed array property read
- we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- type trackeed tricks can possibly support resolving the type for calling this builtin method symbol: $array_slice


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: ['a', 'b', 'c']
 - eval returned: undefined
