## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f([x = $('fail')] = $('pass2')) {
  return x;
}
$(f(1, 2, 3, 200));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...1];\`)`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...1];\`)`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
throw "Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by `const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...1];`)";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let f = function ($$0) {
  const tmpParamBare = $$0;
  debugger;
  let tmpBindingPatternArrRoot = undefined;
  const tmpIfTest = tmpParamBare === undefined;
  if (tmpIfTest) {
    tmpBindingPatternArrRoot = $(`pass2`);
  } else {
    tmpBindingPatternArrRoot = tmpParamBare;
  }
  let tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpBindingPatternArrRoot];
  let tmpAPBD = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
  let x = undefined;
  const tmpIfTest$1 = tmpAPBD === undefined;
  if (tmpIfTest$1) {
    x = $(`fail`);
    return x;
  } else {
    x = tmpAPBD;
    return x;
  }
};
let tmpCalleeParam = f(1, 2, 3, 200);
$(tmpCalleeParam);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
