## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f([{ x = $('fail') } = $({ x: 'fail2' })] = $([{ x: 'fail3' }])) {
  return x;
}
$(f([{ x: null, y: 2, z: 3 }, 20, 30], 200));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(null);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(null);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( null );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) can we always safely clone ident refs in this case?
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) support array reads statement type VarStatement
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: null
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
