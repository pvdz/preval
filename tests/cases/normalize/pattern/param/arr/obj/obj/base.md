> By normalizing patterns we don't have to concern ourselves with its complexities. Defaults are another dimension to take care off and test for.

## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f([
  {
    x: {},
  },
]) {
  return 'ok';
}
$(f([{ x: [{ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }, 12], y: 11 }, 10], 100));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "ok" );
`````


## Todos triggered


- inline computed array property read
- we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'ok'
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
