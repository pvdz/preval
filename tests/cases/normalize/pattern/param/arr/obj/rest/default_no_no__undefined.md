## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f([{ ...x }]) {
  return x;
}
$(f(undefined, 200));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...undefined];\`)`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...undefined];\`)`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
throw "Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by `const tmpArrPatternSplat = [...undefined];`)";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let f = function ($$0) {
  const tmpParamBare = $$0;
  debugger;
  let tmpBindingPatternArrRoot = tmpParamBare;
  let tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpBindingPatternArrRoot];
  let tmpArrPatternStep = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
  let tmpCalleeParam = tmpArrPatternStep;
  let tmpCalleeParam$1 = [];
  let x = $objPatternRest(tmpCalleeParam, tmpCalleeParam$1, undefined);
  return x;
};
let tmpCalleeParam$3 = f(undefined, 200);
$(tmpCalleeParam$3);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) array reads var statement with init CallExpression
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same
