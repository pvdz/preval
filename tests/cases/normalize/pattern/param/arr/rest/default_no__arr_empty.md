## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f([...x]) {
  return x;
}
$(f([], 200));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const x /*:array*/ = [];
$(x);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$([]);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = [];
$( a );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let f = function ($$0) {
  const tmpParamBare = $$0;
  debugger;
  let tmpBindingPatternArrRoot = tmpParamBare;
  let tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpBindingPatternArrRoot];
  const tmpMCF = tmpArrPatternSplat.slice;
  let x = $dotCall(tmpMCF, tmpArrPatternSplat, `slice`, 0);
  return x;
};
const tmpCallCallee = f;
let tmpCalleeParam$1 = [];
let tmpCalleeParam = f(tmpCalleeParam$1, 200);
$(tmpCalleeParam);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) access object property that also exists on prototype? $array_slice
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) type trackeed tricks can possibly support static $array_slice


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: []
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same
