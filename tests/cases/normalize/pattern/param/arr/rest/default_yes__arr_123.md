## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f([...x] = $(['fail'])) {
  return x;
}
$(f([1, 2, 3], 200));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const x /*:array*/ = [1, 2, 3];
$(x);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$([1, 2, 3]);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
$( a );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) access object property that also exists on prototype? $array_slice
- (todo) type trackeed tricks can possibly support static $array_slice
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) support array reads statement type VarStatement


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: [1, 2, 3]
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same
