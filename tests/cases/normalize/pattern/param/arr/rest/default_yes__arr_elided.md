## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f([...x] = $(['fail'])) {
  return x;
}
$(f([, , , 1], 200));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const x /*:array*/ = [undefined, undefined, undefined, 1];
$(x);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$([undefined, undefined, undefined, 1]);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = [ undefined, undefined, undefined, 1 ];
$( a );
`````


## Todos triggered


- replace with $array_slice
- type trackeed tricks can possibly support resolving the type for calling this builtin method symbol: $array_slice


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: [undefined, undefined, undefined, 1]
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same
