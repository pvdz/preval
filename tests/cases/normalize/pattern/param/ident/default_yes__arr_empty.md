## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f(x = 'pass') {
  return x;
}
$(f());
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`pass`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`pass`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "pass" );
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'pass'
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same
