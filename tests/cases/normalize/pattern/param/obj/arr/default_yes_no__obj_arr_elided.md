## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f({ x: [] = $(['fail']) }) {
  return 'ok';
}
$(f({ x: [, , , 1], a: 11, b: 12 }, 10));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "ok" );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) support array reads statement type VarStatement


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'ok'
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same
