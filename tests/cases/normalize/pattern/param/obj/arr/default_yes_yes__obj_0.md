## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f({ x: [] = $(['fail']) } = $({ x: ['fail2'] })) {
  return 'bad';
}
$(f({ x: 0, a: 11, b: 12 }, 10));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`[...0];\`)`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`[...0];\`)`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
throw "Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by `[...0];`)";
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) support array reads statement type VarStatement


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same
