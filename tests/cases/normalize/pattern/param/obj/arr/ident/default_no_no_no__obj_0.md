## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f({ x: [y] }) {
  return 'bad';
}
$(f({ x: 0, a: 11, b: 12 }, 10));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`[...0];\`)`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
throw `Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by \`[...0];\`)`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
throw "Preval: Array spread on non-string primitive must crash (caused by `[...0];`)";
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let f = function ($$0) {
  const tmpParamBare = $$0;
  debugger;
  let tmpBindingPatternObjRoot = tmpParamBare;
  let tmpOPND = tmpBindingPatternObjRoot.x;
  let tmpArrPatternSplat = [...tmpOPND];
  let y = tmpArrPatternSplat[0];
  return `bad`;
};
const tmpCallCallee = f;
let tmpCalleeParam$1 = { x: 0, a: 11, b: 12 };
let tmpCalleeParam = f(tmpCalleeParam$1, 10);
$(tmpCalleeParam);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
