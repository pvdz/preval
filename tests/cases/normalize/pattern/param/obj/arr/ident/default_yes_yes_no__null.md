## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f({ x: [y = 'fail'] = $(['fail2']) }) {
  return 'bad';
}
$(f(null, 10));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
null.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
null.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
null.x;
throw "[Preval]: Can not reach here";
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) inline computed array property read
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
