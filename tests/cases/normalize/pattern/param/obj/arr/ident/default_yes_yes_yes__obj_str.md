## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f({ x: [y = 'fail'] = $(['fail2']) } = $({ x: ['fail3'] })) {
  return y;
}
$(f({ x: 'abc', a: 11, b: 12 }, 10));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`a`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`a`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "a" );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) support array reads statement type ExpressionStatement
- (todo) support array reads statement type VarStatement
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'a'
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
