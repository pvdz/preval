## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f({
  x: [
    {
      y: {},
    },
  ],
}) {
  return 'ok';
}
$(f({ x: [{ x: 15, y: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }, c: 16 }, 13, 14], a: 11, b: 12 }, 10));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "ok" );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) inline computed array property read
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'ok'
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
