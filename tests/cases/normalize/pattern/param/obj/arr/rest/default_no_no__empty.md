## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f({ x: [...y] }) {
  return 'bad';
}
$(f());
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
undefined.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
undefined.x;
throw `[Preval]: Can not reach here`;
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
undefined.x;
throw "[Preval]: Can not reach here";
`````


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: ('<crash[ <ref> is not function/iterable ]>')

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
