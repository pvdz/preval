## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f({ x: [...y] = $(['fail']) } = $({ x: ['fail2'] })) {
  return y;
}
$(f({ x: [1, 2, 3], a: 11, b: 12 }, 10));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const y /*:array*/ = [1, 2, 3];
$(y);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$([1, 2, 3]);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
$( a );
`````


## Todos triggered


- replace with $array_slice
- type trackeed tricks can possibly support resolving the type for calling this builtin method symbol: $array_slice


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: [1, 2, 3]
 - eval returned: undefined
