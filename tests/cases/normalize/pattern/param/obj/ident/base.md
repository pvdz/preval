## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f({ x }) {
  return x;
}
$(f({ x: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }, 10));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 1 );
`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
let f = function ($$0) {
  const tmpParamBare = $$0;
  debugger;
  let tmpBindingPatternObjRoot = tmpParamBare;
  let x = tmpBindingPatternObjRoot.x;
  return x;
};
const tmpCallCallee = f;
let tmpCalleeParam$1 = { x: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
let tmpCalleeParam = f(tmpCalleeParam$1, 10);
$(tmpCalleeParam);
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) support Identifier as var init in let_hoisting noob check


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 1
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
