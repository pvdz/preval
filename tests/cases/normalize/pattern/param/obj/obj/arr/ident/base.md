> By normalizing patterns we don't have to concern ourselves with its complexities. Defaults are another dimension to take care off and test for.

## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f({
  x: {
    y: [z],
  },
}) {
  return z;
}
$(f({ x: { x: 13, y: [1, 2, 3], z: 14 }, b: 11, c: 12 }, 10));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 1 );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?
- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 1
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
