## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f({
  x: {
    y: {},
  },
}) {
  return 'ok';
}
$(f({ x: { x: 13, y: { z: 1, a: 2, b: 3 }, z: 14 }, b: 11, c: 12 }, 10));
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(`ok`);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( "ok" );
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 'ok'
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
