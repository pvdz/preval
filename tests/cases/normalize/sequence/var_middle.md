## Input

`````js filename=intro
const a = (1, 2, (3, 4), 5);
$(a);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(5);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(5);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 5 );
`````


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 5
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
