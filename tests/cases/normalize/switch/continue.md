Need to make sure the `continue` statements in the input still jump to the correct loop. So the loop has to get a label and the continues have to refer to that label.

If the loop already has a label, then that label ought to be used instead since labels cannot nest in this context.

## Input

`````js filename=intro
let run = true;
while (run) {
  $(1);
  switch (1) {
    case 1:
      run = false;
      break;
    default:
      continue;
    case 2:
      run = false;
      break;
  }
}
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(1);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 1 );
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 1
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
