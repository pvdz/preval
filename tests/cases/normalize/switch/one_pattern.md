Should end up something like this (will take some time before we get there :p)

```js
let bindingPatternArrRoot = [4, 5, 6];
let arrPatternSplat = [...bindingPatternArrRoot];
let x = arrPatternSplat[0];
$(x);
```

## Input

`````js filename=intro
switch (1) {
  case 1:
    let [x] = [4, 5, 6];
  case 2:
    $(x);
}
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(4);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(4);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 4 );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) we may be able to confirm that ident refs in the array literal are primitives in same loop/try scope
- (todo) Deal with array spreads in arr mutation?


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 4
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same

Denormalized calls: Same
