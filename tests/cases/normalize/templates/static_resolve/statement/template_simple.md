## Input

`````js filename=intro
`${`I am a string`}`;
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro

`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro

`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro

`````


## Normalized
(This is what phase1 received the first time)

`````js filename=intro
const tmpBinBothLhs = ``;
const tmpBinBothRhs = $coerce(`I am a string`, `string`);
const tmpBinLhs = tmpBinBothLhs + tmpBinBothRhs;
$coerce(tmpBinLhs, `plustr`);
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: undefined
