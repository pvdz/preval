## Input

`````js filename=intro
try {
  var x;
} catch {

## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro

`````

`````js filename=intro
let x = undefined;
`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: undefined

Pre normalization calls: Same

Normalized calls: Same

Post settled calls: Same
