## Input

`````js filename=intro
try {
  var x = 10;
} catch {

}
$(x);
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
$(10);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$(10);
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
$( 10 );
`````


## Todos triggered


- (todo) can try-escaping support this expr node type? Literal


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 10
 - eval returned: undefined
