## Input

`````js filename=intro
"use strict";
function f() {
  "use strict";
  return $();
}
$(f());
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro
const tmpCalleeParam /*:unknown*/ = $();
$(tmpCalleeParam);
`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro
$($());
`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro
const a = $();
$( a );
`````


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - 1: 
 - 2: undefined
 - eval returned: undefined
