## Input

`````js filename=intro
function f() {
  let x = $(1);
  if ($) {
    x = $(2);
    $(x);
  } else {
    // This ref can not reach the assign but it should not prevent SSA
    $(x);
  }
}
`````


## Settled


`````js filename=intro

`````


## Denormalized
(This ought to be the final result)

`````js filename=intro

`````


## PST Settled
With rename=true

`````js filename=intro

`````


## Todos triggered


None


## Globals


None


## Runtime Outcome


Should call `$` with:
 - eval returned: undefined
