// TOFIX regressions:

// tests/cases/normalize/loops/base_return_cond.md -> used to be able to output a series of completely resolved $() with the second params resolved to numbers
// tests/cases/normalize/nullish/global_nested_assign.md -> used to be able to inline the obj.prop assign and end with `{ b: 15 }` (same tests/cases/normalize/nullish/func_nested_assign.md)
// tests/cases/normalize/dce/throw/fence_at_loop_dowhile.md -> regression?
// tests/cases/normalize/expressions/assignments/do_while/auto_ident_upd_ip_simple.md -> should detect that `a` is invariably overwritten in the loop. maybe a ref tracking bug (perhaps it considers while(true) an optional branch)
// tests/cases/unwind_loops/counter_test/unroll_option_too_low.md used to be able to eliminate the array entirely
// tests/cases/ssa/back2back_x_x_plus_1_assign42.md -> was able to SSA the x but somehow this stopped working after label extending.
// Apparently tests/cases/templates/nested_multi.md broke a long time ago

// TODO:

// tests/cases/normalize/branching/single_branching/_base_nested_else_no_tail.md -> find a way to consolidate?
// tests/cases/normalize/expressions/assignments/for_of_left/auto_ident_logic_and_and.md -> add test that prints a when it does not enter the for-loop body. (this was a fix that used to be broken)
// tests/cases/normalize/expressions/assignments/for_c/auto_ident_logic_||_simple_complex.md -> rename file to eliminate the pipes?
// while unroll transform does a `if (x) yes=1 else yes=0 if (yes) { while ...} else {}`. it should store the while in the if-branch.
// Redundant write: try { $(); } catch (e) { e = 1; $(e); e = 1; $(e); }
// tests/cases/testers/base.md -> consider the while(true) transient and then detect that x is only true once. then we can move one branch outside
// tests/cases/normalize/dce/return/decl_after_looped_infi.md -> when a branch exits the loop we could replace it with a break and move the branch to after the loop? but I guess only if there are no other breaks. maybe too edge casy
// investigate while(true) loops and if there are cases where we could rotate statements in the body, then move one out before/after. the loop is wrap-around after all.
// nested labels can be squashed when they have no tail
// tests/cases/normalize/expressions/assignments/for_b/auto_ident_opt_simple_opt_simple.md -> trivial infinite loops could gobble the previous statement(s) if it is the same as the body
// the loopStop label pattern could be rewritten in a var-if-test way
// while unrolling can be super generic now with one break in the loop body, and probably even if there are multiple
// tests/cases/tofix/infinite_loops2.md -> while with nested while (nothing else in root body) could eliminate outer while by compiling breaks like you do for continue
// tests/cases/while/const_test_true.md -> (but then not global) if a variable is not a closure and is tested twice in a row without writes in between then it must have the same boolean value. `if (x) { $(); if (x)` -> `if (x) $(); if (true)`. Trickier for globals I guess,
// tests/cases/unwind_loops/separate_test/multi_loop_test_nested.md -> a counter that only increases can probably have its value inferred even if in a loop?
// tests/cases/while/unobservable_ops_global.md -> `s |= 10` when `s` is not observable inside the loop nor escapes, is going to do the same thing no matter how often you do it
// do proper alwaysBreak and alwaysComplete analysis in phase1
// tests/cases/unroll_loop_with_true/obj_prop_key.md -> pst goes off the rails for computed property
// in normalization, the label step that eliminates function toplevel labels should not use globallyUniqueLabelRegistry because it may be stale. it should walk and search for all breaks that target this label.
// why is the jsfck case crashing?
// is while-rotating sound when the body breaks more than once?
// infinite loop tests are set to $LOOP_DONE_UNROLLING_ALWAYS_TRUE in reduce_static/infinite_loops.mjs but we should find a way in normalize instead
// tests/cases/array/static_props/escape.md should not inline the length there
// tests/cases/array/read_only/computed_prop.md -> we should be able to resolve array props until it escapes. especially when its not a closure.
// tests/cases/normalize/expressions/statement/while/auto_ident_logic_or_or.md -> if a var declared above a label that doesnt escape is only used inside that label then it can be moved inside too, same rule as in the end of transformLabeledStatement but it needs to be phase2 due to scope tracking
// tests/cases/continue/double.md -> has double label output
// tests/cases/normalize/switch/simple_abrupt_cases/simple_unconditional_break.md -> implicit global case
// tests/cases/normalize/expressions/assignments/for_b/auto_ident_nested_simple_member_assigns.md -> collapse object prop assignments when we know its a literal (we assume builtins are sound)
// AST.isNumber -> AST.isNumberLiteral AST.isNumberValue
// reduce_static/if_reduce_up.mjs -> need to inject a TDZ check before the hoist (maybe rename the rule too? if-hoisting or something? maybe)
// verify whether $p.isPrimitive is correct to be set in phase1 (but probably?)
// Support object literals in isSameExpressionExceptBool too
// Support async and generator functions in inlineSimpleFuncCalls / reduce_static/simple_funcs.mjs
// tests/cases/function/pure_function_inlining.md -> Take it the last step and outline the tail end of the string too so the function can be eliminated
